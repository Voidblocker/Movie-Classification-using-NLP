    "*The objective is to extract meaningful topics using two different topic modelling approaches: LDA and BERTopic. The task is to identify thematic structures within the movie synopses (using the synopsis column in the available data) and compare the topics generated by the traditional method (LDA) with those produced by the more recent, embedding-based method (BERTopic).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for Topic Modeling with LDA and BERTopic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "   - Clean the dataset by removing any special characters and numbers, perform tokenization, remove stop words, and apply stemming or lemmatization.\n",
    "   - Ensure the data is in a suitable format for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LDA Topic Modeling\n",
    "   - Convert the cleaned text data into a useful format.\n",
    "   - Train the LDA model, choosing an appropriate number of topics based on the dataset.\n",
    "   - Interpret and label the topics using the top words associated with each topic from the LDA model.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the LDA model performance using coherence scores and perplexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BERTopic Modeling\n",
    "   - Install the BERTopic library if not already available in your environment.\n",
    "   - Fit the BERTopic model to the raw text data, which will utilize BERT embeddings for creating semantically rich topics.\n",
    "   - Interpret and label the topics using BERTopic's feature of extracting top words for each topic.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the BERTopic model by analyzing topic coherence and stability (coherence score).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comparison and Analysis\n",
    "   - Compare the topics generated by LDA and BERTopic, discussing the differences in terms of coherence, interpretability, and the granularity of topics.\n",
    "   - Analyze the practicality of both methods in terms of computational cost and ease of use.\n",
    "   - Discuss which method produced more meaningful and distinct topics and hypothesize why that might be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conclusion\n",
    "   - Conclude with a reflection on the benefits and limitations of each method.\n",
    "   - Provide recommendations for which types of datasets each method might be better suited for.\n",
    "   - Encourage discussion about the potential for combining both methods or using them in different stages of a larger data analysis pipeline."
